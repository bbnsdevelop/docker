Steps to Use the File:

Save the YAML file as datadog-agent.yml or any name you prefer.
Replace <YOUR_DATADOG_API_KEY> with your Datadog API key. You can get it from your Datadog account settings.


Run the Datadog Agent container using Docker Compose local:
docker-compose -f datadog-agent.yml up -d

Key Features in the Configuration:
Docker Monitoring: The Datadog Agent monitors Docker containers through the mounted Docker socket.
Log Collection: The DD_LOGS_ENABLED and DD_LOGS_CONFIG_CONTAINER_COLLECT_ALL settings enable automatic log collection from all containers.
APM and DogStatsD: Ports 8126 and 8125 are exposed for trace and custom metric collection.
Container Exclusion: The Agent excludes itself (name:datadog-agent) to avoid collecting its own metrics.
Feel free to customize the file further to meet your specific needs, such as adding specific integrations or configuring tags. Let me know if you need help with additional customization!
